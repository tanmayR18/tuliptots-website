        At Tulip Tots International, we envision a world where every child
        blossoms with curiosity, confidence, and creativity. Inspired by the
        symbolism of the tulip, we aim to cultivate growth, beauty, and
        resilience in every child. Through a play-based, international approach,
        we prepare children to become global citizens who are grounded in strong
        values and bloom with innovative ideas that impact the world.
