            When you step into a thoughtfully designed early childhood environment,
            you'll notice a different kind of play unfolding. Children aren't just
            pushing buttons or following preset instructions. They are building
            castles from blocks, transforming scarves into superhero capes, and
            creating worlds out of simple objects. This is the magic of open-ended
            toys — the kind of playthings that don't dictate how they should be
            used, but invite imagination, creativity, and endless possibilities.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Open-ended toys are materials that can be played with in multiple ways,
            depending entirely on the child's imagination and intention. They do not
            have a "right" way to be used, and they don't do the playing for the
            child. Instead, they encourage problem-solving, experimentation, and
            storytelling.

            In contrast, closed-ended toys — like most battery-operated toys or
            single-purpose puzzles — have a fixed outcome or way to use them.
            Open-ended toys, on the other hand, stretch children's thinking in
            powerful ways.

            The 90/10 Rule of Play: Child 90%, Toy 10%

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                When a toy doesn't "do" everything, the child's mind fills in the gaps. A
                wooden block can become a car, a phone, or a spaceship — all in a
                matter of minutes!

                Open-ended materials challenge children to invent, construct, and

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Through imaginative play, children process emotions, re-enact

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                When children create their own play scenarios, they naturally
                narrate, describe, and dialogue — growing rich communication skills
                along the way.

            Play Is Not About the Toy — It's About the Child

          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              The goal of early childhood play isn't about entertaining children —
              it's about empowering them. When a toy "entertains" too much, it
              steals the child's opportunity to create, solve, and dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the child is in charge of the play, they build the very skills —
              creativity, adaptability, problem-solving — that form the foundation
              for lifelong learning.

              At Tulip Tots International, our environments are intentionally
              designed with open-ended toys and materials that spark imagination and
              grow confident, capable thinkers.
