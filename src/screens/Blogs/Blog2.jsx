            Starting nursery is a huge milestone in your child's life — and yours!
            It's the beginning of new friendships, learning adventures, and a
            growing sense of independence. One of the best gifts you can give your
            child before they start nursery is confidence — the belief that they are
            capable, loved, and ready to explore the world beyond home.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mb-4">1. Let Them Try (and Sometimes Struggle)</h2>

                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                It can be tempting to step in quickly when your child is trying to
                zip up a jacket or build a block tower. But allowing toddlers the
                space to try things for themselves, even if they don't get it right
                the first time, builds resilience and self-esteem.
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Celebrate their efforts, not just their successes: "You worked so
                hard to put on your shoes! I'm proud of you for trying!"
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                The focus is not on perfection, but on persistence.

          {/* Tip 2 */}

            <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Offering small choices gives toddlers a sense of control and
                strengthens decision-making skills.
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Simple options work best: Would you like the red cup or the blue
                cup? Do you want to wear your dinosaur t-shirt or your striped one?
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                This daily practice of making decisions helps children feel more
                independent and confident — a skill they'll carry with them into
                nursery life.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mb-4">3. Practice Self-Help Skills</h2>
            <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Starting nursery often means doing some things without a parent
                nearby: putting on shoes, feeding themselves, washing hands.
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Practicing these skills at home — patiently and playfully — can
                make a big difference.
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Turn it into a game: "Let's race to see who can put on their shoes
                first!" or "Can you be the hand-washing superhero today?"
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                When children know they can manage basic tasks, they step into
                nursery with a real sense of pride.

              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Play allows children to process feelings, ask questions, and build
                familiarity with the idea of nursery.
              </p>
            </div>

          {/* Tip 5 */}

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-pink-600 mb-4">5. Acknowledge Their Feelings</h2>
            <div className="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                Confidence doesn't mean never feeling scared or uncertain.
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                If your child expresses worries, listen calmly and validate their
                emotions: "It's okay to feel a little nervous. Trying something new
                can feel big. And guess what? You're brave enough to do big things!"
              </p>
              <p className="flex items-start">
                <span className="text-pink-500 mr-2">◆</span>
                When children know their feelings are accepted, they feel stronger
                inside — not because everything is easy, but because they are
                supported.

            moment builds the foundation for bigger adventures ahead.
